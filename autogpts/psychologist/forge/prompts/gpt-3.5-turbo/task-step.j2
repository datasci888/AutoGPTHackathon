Your task is:
Translate detailed information about the AI tool "EmoSync" into a structured representation. Ensure capabilities to:
- Process video frames to derive health metrics.
- Produce guided psychotherapy content with autogenerated music using AI.
- Parse and analyze content from directly uploaded or scraped PDFs.
- Collect and act upon real-time user feedback.
- Integrate with external health systems, updating user profiles in the Weaviate Vector Database.
- Support multiple languages for a global user base.

Answer in the provided format.

Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.

## Constraints
- Generating profile for EmoSync based on AutoGPT.
- Capture the pitch for EmoSync.
- Extract key details from sections like Introduction, Objective, etc.
- Ensure that all subsections under these sections are also included.
- Execute generated code, assess its output, and refine or regenerate as necessary in an iterative manner.
- Due to the breadth of the content, the structure might be dense. Consider breaking it into multiple tasks if necessary.

## Resources
- DeepFace for emotion detection from images
- Clarifai for AI-based image and video recognition
- AssemblyAI for transcription services
- Weaviate Vector Database for data storage and handling
- Code Generator & Modifier for generating, refining, and executing code
- External Data Processors for finger pulse and smart/fitness watches
- Feedback Mechanism for collecting and acting upon user feedback
- API Connectors for integration with external health systems
- User Profile Management tools
- Continuous Learning Frameworks for AI model refinements
- Multi-Language Processing Tools for global support
- PDF Parsers for reading and interpreting PDF content
- Web Scrapers for obtaining PDFs from web sources
- OCR Tools for extracting text from image-based PDFs

## Abilities
- Translate profile information
- Process video frames to derive health metrics such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and more
- Process and analyze finger pulse data and data from smart/fitness watches
- Return a dictionary of health metrics from all processed inputs
- Iterative Code Execution: Execute, assess, and refine generated code until achieving the desired outcome
- Collect, analyze, and act upon real-time user feedback
